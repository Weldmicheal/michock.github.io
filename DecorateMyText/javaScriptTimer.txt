1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);

Ans: In the first case booyah function is invoked after waiting 2000ms where as in the second case booyah function is invoked immediately
rather than waiting 2000ms. 

2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
var myfunc = function(a, x) {
 return a * x;
};
var x = myfunc(2, 3);
var y = myfunc;
alert(x); 
alert(y(2,3)); 

Ans: 
alert(x); displays  6
alert(y(2,3)); displays 6

3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
says “BOOYAH!”
setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);

Ans:

function booyah1 () {
	alert("BOOYAH!");
}
function booyah2() {
	setTimeout(delay, 2000);
	
}
function delay() {

4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
for using it)?

Ans: Unobtrusive JavaScript is the way of writing JavaScript language in which we properly separate our webpage content
in to three 3 major categories:
1. Document content(HTM)- what is it?
2. Presentation(CSS)- how it looks?
3. Behavior(JavaScript)-How it responds to user interaction?

Unobtrusive JavaScript contains an HTML web page with minimal JavaScript inside it. Moreover, it uses DOM to attach and 
execute all JavaScript functions. The applications/reasons for using unobtrusive JavaScript include:
-It separates our website contents,i.e., it has better style,
-Keeps our code clean,
-Allows us to work on the JavaScripts without touching CSS or HTML,
-It makes our code less error prone, easy to debug and update.
